# Bone-fracture Detection Tool : 

![Screenshot at 2023-03-27 13-44-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99510125/227933352-dcca50e6-9709-4475-ae6f-d49f1351d19a.png)

This system utilizes deep learning algorithms to detect bone fractures in X-ray images. The YOLO model is trained on a labeled dataset of X-ray images with annotated bounding boxes around the fractures.

When a new X-ray image is fed into the system, the YOLO model analyzes the image and predicts the location of any fractures present in the image. This information can be displayed to a radiologist or other medical professional to assist in diagnosing the fracture accurately and quickly.

The system has the potential to reduce the time and effort required for manual analysis of X-ray images, which can help to improve patient outcomes and increase the efficiency of medical practices. However, it's important to note that this system should not be used as a replacement for a trained medical professional's diagnosis, but rather as a tool to aid in their diagnosis.
